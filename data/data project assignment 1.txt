I would like to study the effects of various state level drug policies on opioid overdose mortality using a Difference in Differences Framework. The Policies I will evaluate are Good Samaritan Law,  Morphine Equivalent Daily Dose (MEDD) Law, Decriminalization of Paraphernalia, Naloxone Access Laws (NAL), Medical Marijuana Laws, and Prescription Drug Monitoring (PDMP) Laws. I will use data from lawatlas.org and the Prescription Drug Abuse Policy System (PDAPS) for policy data and CDC deaths data for the outcome variable.

I plan to control for one national policy change, the reformulation of Oxycontin to deter abuse of prescription opioids, in an appendix table model, but as a national policy (varying over time but not across states) this is already controlled for in the model.

Data Sources:

Overdose deaths (state, year, and month)
https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/VSRR-Provisional-Drug-Overdose-Death-Counts/xkb8-kh2a

*data are current, but only go back to 2015

or

https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd.html

*would allow me to demonstrate a longer pre-trend, but data are less current

I could use both data sources to construct the panel, but this would be more work and difficult to ensure that I am "stacking" them correctly (without bias.)

Good Samaratan Laws by state over time

through June 1, 2021.

MEDD policies

Paraphernalia laws
http://lawatlas.org/datasets/paraphernalia-laws
This is a longitudinal dataset, and captures laws in effect from July 1, 2012 through July 1, 2017

Reformulation of Oxycontin effective date

Naloxone Access Laws
http://pdaps.org/datasets/laws-regulating-administration-of-naloxone-1501695139
January 1, 2001 through July 1, 2017

Medical Marijuana Laws
http://pdaps.org/datasets/medical-marijuana-patient-related-laws-1501600783
This dataset is longitudinal displaying laws effective as of January 1, 2014 through February 1, 2017

PDMP

Comprehensive documentation exist for all the tables I link to above.

Links between these datasets should be possible via the abbreviation of the state name, month, and year. Using these linkages, I should be able to construct a panel dataset with opioid overdose deaths and the explanatory policy variables I am interested in.

Since many of the laws are not updated past 2017, I'll probably restrict my analysis to years before 2018.
